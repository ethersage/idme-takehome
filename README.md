## Assumptions base on ambiguity

The following is a list of assumptions I made where the user stories were ambiguous or didn't match the sample dataset

1. The figma has a picture of company logos like Apple and Whole Foods, but the only image provided by the dataset were stock images, so I used the stock images as if they were logos and scaled them down. If I had more time, I would use Next.js images to do the scaling instead of the browser.
1. I couldn't find a font called Source Sans Pro, so I used google's Source Sans 3.
1. The header "Purchases" is in a different font than the rest of the page, but I couldn't find it in the figma so I used Source Sans 3.
